-- | Transform a "tagged variable" into its @Text@ representation.

-- It is necessary since during solving, we need to perform alpha-conversion to
-- avoid variable capture. Therefore we "tag" the variables with a unique number
-- (namely the step count) to avoid name clashes. In other words, during
-- solving, we are actually dealing with "tagged @Text@"s. Upon reaching the
-- solution, we need to "untag" them to get the original variables (creating
-- fresh variables if necessary).

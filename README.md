# Hrolog

## Introduction
Hrolog is a [logic programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) that highly resembles [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog). It will support both SLDNF-deduction and abduction as well as some logic-based learning algorithms. In the future, it may also support a Clingo-like Answer Set Programming semantics.

Note that Hrolog is NOT Prolog: they have different syntaxes, and Hrolog will only implement a subset of Prolog specification while adding some unique features.
